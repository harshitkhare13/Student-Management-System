it simply provides a graphical user interface to the user to insert, 
update as well as retrieve data from the database of students 
studying in different year and different sections of the university.

Tools & Packages used:  
1. Java 9 (to compile and run java code using jvm)
2. MySql 5.0 (for storing data in database)
3. Atom Editor (for writing java code)
4. Javax Swings {Javax.swings.*} package (to design the GUI)
5. Javax table {javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel} package (to display the stored data)
6. Java event {java.awt.event} package (to make GUI dynamic)
